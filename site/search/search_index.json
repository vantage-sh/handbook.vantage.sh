Depending on the nature of your applications, you may not have a choice but to be located as close to your users as possible for latency purposes. That being said, it is worth looking at pricing on a per region basis as there can be significant discounts on a per-region basis.","title":"Regions"},{"location":"aws/concepts/reserved-instances/","text":"Reserved Instances (oftentimes referred to as their abbreviation of RIs) are one of the most popular and high-impact cost reduction methods you can leverage for cutting your bill. Reserved Instances give you the ability to pay upfront for certain AWS services to receive a discount. As a result, if you are able to profile usage across your AWS account and know that you'll hit certain usage levels, Reserved Instances can typically save you money. Reserved Instances are availabile to a variety of AWS services such as EC2 , ElastiCache and RDS . AWS Billing automatically applies your Reserved Instance discounted rate when attributes of your instance usage match attributes of an active Reserved Instance. For general compute usage (EC2, Fargate, etc.), Savings Plans are always preferred to Reserved Instances as they give you the same discount but are more flexible across all compute. It's important to note that Reserved Instances aren't actually separate instances. They are merely financial instruments that you buy and are automatically applied to your account. As a result, you can continue to spin up and use on-demand instances and purchase Reserved Instances concurrently. As on-demand instances match your Reserved Instance attributes, you'll automatically receive discounts. Reserved Instance Term AWS gives different discounts depending on the term that you pay upfront for. You can yield greater savings for paying upfront for longer terms but lose flexibility as a result. We find that smaller customers just getting started in their infrastructure journey tend to prefer 1-Year Reserved Instances whereas more mature organizations will leverage 3-Year Reserved Instances for the greatest savings as they can more accurately model and predict their usage.","title":"Reserved Instances"},{"location":"aws/concepts/reserved-instances/#reserved-instance-term","text":"AWS gives different discounts depending on the term that you pay upfront for.

Typically rightsizing occures when you're over-provisioned and can apply to a variety of services with some examples below: EC2 Instances : Oftentimes customers will choose one EC2 Instance that is over-allocated in terms the amount of vCPU and GB of RAM it is allocated. As a result, customers may be paying more on a per EC2-Instance basis. Customers who are able to identify opportunitites for rightsizing EC2 Instances can typically save significantly, especially if the EC2 Instance type chosen represents a large pool of instances. EBS Volumes : EBS Volumes are typically a large cost driver for many organizations and are often heavily under-utilized. EBS charges you for the amount of storage you have allocated versus utilize so its important to keep an eye on Volume utilization to rightsize and save accordinly. RDS Instances : RDS Instances are similar to EC2 Instances in that they're typically overprovisioned but rarely utilized appropriately. While RDS rightsizing can result in significant cost savings, databases tend to be one of the services that makes sense to leave overprovisioned that you can grow into as downtime for a database during a rightsizing process may not ultimatately be worth the organization cost. Container Services : ECS, Fargate and EKS allow you to run services of containers on a pool of underlying EC2 instances either managed by you or managed by AWS if you're using Fargate. Container Services are some of the hardest services to appropriately rightsize but can represent significant saving opportunities, especially for AWS Fargate. The first step in rightsizing is to have monitoring and observability in place to even know what your utilization is for these various services. Assuming you feel confident in your usage patterns and how they relate to utilization, your organization can begin to make some decision for potential area to rightsize.","title":"Rightsizing"},{"location":"aws/concepts/savings-plans/","text":"Savings Plans are a flexible pricing model offering discounted prices compared to On-Demand pricing, in exchange for a specific usage commitment. Savings Plans are typically the highest impact, lowest effort way of realizing savings on your AWS account. They are roughly the same concept as Reserved Instances but offer greater flexiblity as they 1) can be utilized across multiple compute services (i.e., EC2 and Fargate) and 2) you aren't locked into a specific instance family. Similar to Reserved Instances, there are greater discounts for prepaying for a longer term. After purchasing a Savings Plan, AWS Billing will automatically apply savings as corresponding on-demand resources match the conditions of your Savings Plans. Savings Plans are only applicable to usage across Amazon EC2, AWS Lambda, and AWS Fargate. Typically, customers will use Savings Plans for these services and Reserved Instances for other services that aren't covered such as RDS and ElastiCache.","title":"Savings Plans"},{"location":"aws/concepts/tags/","text":"Tags are one of the most powerful (though often overlooked) tools that can assist with your ability to observe and allocate cloud costs as it relates to public cloud infrastructure providers like AWS, Azure and GCP. While different AWS accounts can be useful for separating resources and costs across different environments (production, staging, qa, test, etc) or teams/business-units, tags are helpful for segmenting costs as it relates to your application. We encourage customers to adopt tagging strategies as early on at their organizations as possible. Similar to an effective unit testing suite, over time tags can give you confidence in understanding where your costs are coming from. Tags on AWS consist of two different parts: a key and a value . As a basic example you can imagine an example key with the value of \"service\" and potential value s of \"front-end\", \"back-end\", \"search\" or \"cache\". Upon assigning tags to resources, you can get greater visibility into where your costs are coming from. Instead of seeing how your costs are trending in aggregate, you can see how each part of your application is growing assuming you've leveraged tags correctly. Additionally, tags can be part of your existing workflows and are typically very easy to accomodate in infrastructure-as-code configuration files such as CloudFormation or Terraform. Activating Cost Allocation Tags One of the more generally confusing experiences that customers experience on AWS is that tags are not incorporated into billing reports by default and need to be \"activated\". After you have assigned resources tags, here are the steps to \"activate\" the tags for them to be incorporated into billing data: To activate your tags Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the Billing and Cost Management console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/tags . In the navigation pane, choose Cost Allocation Tags. Select the tags that you want to activate. Choose Activate. After you create and apply tags to your resources, it can take up to 24 hours for the tags to appear in your reports. After you select your tags for activation, it can take up to 24 hours for tags to activate as well.","title":"Tags"},{"location":"aws/concepts/tags/#activating-cost-allocation-tags","text":"One of the more generally confusing experiences that customers experience on AWS is that tags are not incorporated into billing reports by default and need to be \"activated\".

There are multiple EBS \"Volume Types\" that offer different capabilites and have their own set of pricing. EBS costs are factored into the cost category of \"EC2-Other\" on your AWS bill which can oftentimes complicate understanding where these costs are coming from. It is important to note that you are charged for the amount of provisioned storage not utilized storage. So, for example, if you create a 20GB EBS Volume and only utilize 1GB of it, you are still charged for all 20GB. Pricing Dimensions Volume Storage Hours : When you create an EBS Volume you allocate a certain amount of storage to it. Ultimately the main cost of an EBS Volume is the result of the amount of hours you're using an EBS Volume and the size you allocate. Volume Type : EBS has different types of Volume Types which are documented below. Each Volume Type has different rates. Provisioned IOPS : Certain EBS Volume types (io2, io2) allow you to specific an amount of provisioned input/output operations per second which is abbreviated as IOPS and pronounced as \"eye-ops\". When using these volume types you are charged for the amount of provisioned iops even if you don't fully utilize them. Amazon EBS Snapshots : Amazon EBS Snapshots are a point in time copy of your block volume data. EBS Snapshots are stored incrementally, which means you are billed only for the changed blocks stored. EBS Snapshot API Requests : EBS charges you for the amount of API calls you make for snapshots. These are charged in increments of thousands of API requests. Volume Types Amazon EBS offers a few diffrent Volume Types that have different pricing rates and functionality. Each EBS Volume Type is described below: General Purpose SSD (gp2, gp3) : General Purpose SSD (gp3) volumes offer cost-effective storage that is ideal for a broad range of workloads. Provisioned IOPS (io1, io2) : Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1 and io2) volumes are designed to meet the needs of I/O-intensive workloads, particularly database workloads, that are sensitive to storage performance and consistency. Provisioned IOPS SSD volumes use a consistent IOPS rate, which you specify when you create the volume, and Amazon EBS delivers the provisioned performance 99.9 percent of the time. Stranded Volumes Oftentimes, EBS Volumes are created in conjunction with other AWS resources such as EC2 instances but are de-coupled from the lifecycle of those other resources. One common pattern we see is that developers will create EC2 instances with EBS Volumes attached but when they delete the EC2 instance, they assume that the EBS Volume is destroyed accordingly. In larger-scale environments with autoscaling this problem can grow significantly as a part of an AWS bill.

EC2-Other encompasses the following costs: EBS Volume Usage : Usage for EBS Volumes . EBS Snapshot Usage : Usage for EBS Snapshots . CPU Credits from t2/t3/t4g EC2 instances : T-family EC2 Instances can carry potential CPU credit charges as described more below. NAT Gateway Usage : Hourly usage for NAT Gateways.

Amazon EC2 allows customers to create virtual private servers and has different pricing depending on the \u201cinstance type\u201d you use. Instance types are grouped into families with varying generations. Each instance type has a different mix of underlying hardware, allocated resources and as a result: pricing. Additionally, depending on the underlying software running on the EC2 instance you may be charged different rates. Pricing Dimensions Instance Type Usage : EC2 instance types are billed on one second increments, with a minimum of 60 seconds. For certain instance types with pre-installed software, you are billed in increments of hours. Instance Type Lifecycle : EC2 has different lifecycle types - the two most often used are on-demand and spot. These concepts are discussed more in-depth below. AMI : AMI stands for Amazon Machine Images. Depending on the AMI you use (i.e., Linux vs Windows) you potentially pay an additional amount of money on top of the instance type base usage. On-Demand vs Spot By default, EC2 instances are launched in \"on-demand\" mode and charged accompanying on-demand rates which are the most expensive. AWS also offers \"Spot\" instances which can offer significant cost savings by using unused additional compute capacity. However, Spot tends to only work for fault-tolerant workloads as AWS can pre-empt and terminate these instances within two minutes if need be. Depending on your application's needs, you can consider using Spot instances for significant cost savings in the event you are comfortable with these instances being terminated. In general, your application's architecture should be comfortable with either 1) there being no spot instances available or 2) these instances being terminated. Rightsizing Rightsizing refers to the process of ensuring that you're using the proper instance type suited for your application or workload. For example if you're using the largest instance type in a particular family but not using the CPU, Storage and Memory allocated to it fully you may be overpaying for what you need. Rightsizing is usually a manual process that involves engineering time for looking at a combination of application-level performance metrics like application CPU and Memory consumption and infrastructure-related attributes like what kind of underlying CPU powers an instance type.

You can create as many \"Repositories\" as you'd like that are free. As you push container \"Images\" to your repository, you're charged for the storage of these images which can acrue over time. Additionally, ECR charges different data transfer rates for private versus public repositories. Pricing Dimensions Container Image Storage : Amazon ECR charges a rate per month for the amount of storage per GB you store for container images. Data Transfer : Amazon ECR charges different rates for data transfer from public and private repositories. Storage Costs per ECR Repository Determining the cost per Container Repository can be a lot of effort, especially if you have a large quantity of images. To calculate the storage cost per container repository: List all of your container images Collect the image digest from each Determine just the unique digests of the layers in your container repository Get the size of each unique digest. If you prefer not to do this manually yourself, Vantage will compute the size and corresponding cost of all repositories automatically when you connect an AWS account. Lifecycle Policies ECR stores every container image you push to a registry by default. Over time, the storage of all of these images can add up. Amazon offers a primitive called a \"Lifecycle Policy\" that allows you to set conditions for having Amazon clean up images on your behalf. There are two types of lifeycle policies: imageCountMoreThan : ECR allows you to define a certain number of images to retain and anything over that count will be cleaned up. For example if you set a Lifecycle Policy with a imageCountMoreThan value of 10, your most recent 10 images will always be kept. sinceImagePushed : ECR allows you to set lifecycle policies with a value of sinceImagePushed which has a value of a certain number of days. So for example if you have a Lifecycle Policy applied with a sinceImagePushed value of 7, ECR will delete images as often as they are older than 7 days. Note : that when you apply a Lifecycle Policy, it is evaluated immediately. So if you have 500 images in a repositority and impose a lifeycle policy of 10 as soon as that policy is applied ECR will delete the 490 oldest images. Example imageCountMoreThan Lifeycle Policy Here's an example of how to impose a Lifeycle Policy via the AWS CLI using the value of imageCountMoreThan: aws ecr put-lifecycle-policy \\ --repository-name \"vantage/mcyolo\" \\ --lifecycle-policy-text \"file://policy.json\" Where the content of the file for policy.json is the following: { \"rules\": [ { \"rulePriority\": 1, \"description\": \"Expire images over a count of 10\", \"selection\": { \"tagStatus\": \"untagged\", \"countType\": \"imageCountMoreThan\", \"countNumber\": 10 }, \"action\": { \"type\": \"expire\" } } ] } Example sinceImagePushed Lifeycle Policy Here's an example of how to impose a Lifeycle Policy via the AWS CLI using the value of sinceImagePushed: aws ecr put-lifecycle-policy \\ --repository-name \"vantage/mcyolo\" \\ --lifecycle-policy-text \"file://policy.json\" Where the content of the file for policy.json is the following: { \"rules\": [ { \"rulePriority\": 1, \"description\": \"Expire images older than 14 days\", \"selection\": { \"tagStatus\": \"untagged\", \"countType\": \"sinceImagePushed\", \"countUnit\": \"days\", \"countNumber\": 14 }, \"action\": { \"type\": \"expire\" } } ] }","title":"ECR"},{"location":"aws/services/ecr-pricing/#summary","text":"Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) is a fully managed container registry that allows you to store container images.

For example if you set a Lifecycle Policy with a imageCountMoreThan value of 10, your most recent 10 images will always be kept. sinceImagePushed : ECR allows you to set lifecycle policies with a value of sinceImagePushed which has a value of a certain number of days. So for example if you have a Lifecycle Policy applied with a sinceImagePushed value of 7, ECR will delete images as often as they are older than 7 days.

Ultimately you are charged on the dimensions below but are a mix of how much you store with specific storage types, the bandwidth for accessing those files and the requests you make to the S3 service. Pricing Dimensions Object Storage Amount : Amazon S3 charges you for how much you store across all objects across all buckets. There is different pricing rates per region on a per-GB basis and as you store more data on S3, you get discounts on a per-GB basis. Object Storage Class : Amazon S3 has many different Storage Classes which are discussed below. \"Standard Storage\" is the default storage class but you can get discounts for other tiers. Bandwidth : Amazon S3 charges you for the amount of egress you consume for accessing S3 objects. You should keep an eye on how much bandwidth is being consumed especially if files are left open to the public where you can potentially have runaway costs if signifcant usage occurs. Request Metrics : Amazon charges you for GET, SELECT, PUT, COPY, POST and LIST requests. Amazon also charges you different rates depending on which of these request types you're using. This is oftentimes an unknown cost that customers occur that you should keep an eye on. Intelligent Tiering S3 Intelligent Tiering is an Amazon S3 storage class that automatically will optimize storage costs automatically on behalf of customers. S3 Intelligent Tiering will monitor access patterns of S3 objects on your behalf and shift them between four different storage classes on your behalf to deliver you with savings automatically. Typically customers have files that they store with the storage class of Standard Storage but don't think to ever optimize these costs and overpay for the the amount they're storing in S3. By using Intelligent Tiering, customers can focus on their application development and allow S3 Intelligent Tiering to manage shifting their objects' storage classes on their behalf. Understanding Storage Classes S3 currently supports 19 different object storage types within an S3 Bucket. Each bucket is capable of holding objects from a single class or multiple classes. A light overview of these storage types are below: Standard Storage\u200d : Standard Storage (StandardStorage) is for general purpose storage for any type of data, typically used for frequently accessed data. Standard Storage is priced on a tiered basis where it gets incrementally cheaper to store data as you store more. Intelligent Tiering - Frequent Access (IntelligentTieringFAStorage)**: Objects uploaded to S3 Intelligent Tiering are automatically stored in the frequent access tier which has the same rates as Standard Storage. Intelligent Tiering - Infrequent Access (IntelligentTieringIAStorage): Objects in Frequent Access that haven't been accessed in 30 consecutive days are moved to this tier in which prices drop significantly. Intelligent Tiering - Archive Access (IntelligentTieringAAStorage) : Upon activating the archive access tier for intelligent tiering, S3 will automatically move objects that haven't been accessed for 90 days to archive access where the pricing is the same as Glacier. Intelligent Tiering - Deep Archive Access (IntelligentTieringDAAStorage) : Upon activating the deep archive access tier for intelligent tiering, S3 will automatically move objects that haven't been accessed for 180 days to deep archive access. S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (StandardIAStorage) : S3 Standard Infrequent Access is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. It offers the high durability, high throughput, and low latency of S3 Standard, with a low per GB storage price and per GB retrieval fee. This combination of low cost and high performance make S3 Standard-IA ideal for long-term storage, backups, and as a data store for disaster recovery files. Standard Infrequenty Access Overhead (StandardIASizeOverhead) : There is a minimum billable size of 128KB. For example if you stored an object at 28KB, the StandardIASizeOverhead rate would increase by 128KB-28KB or 100KB and represented by this metric. S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (One Zone) : S3 Infrequent Access One Zone is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed. Unlike other S3 Storage Classes which store data in a minimum of three Availability Zones, S3 Infrequent Access One Zone stores data in a single AZ and costs 20% less than S3 Standard Infrequent Access. One Zone Size Overhead (OneZoneIASizeOverhead) : There is a minimum billable size of 128KB. For example if you stored an object at 28KB, the StandardIASizeOverhead rate would increase by 128KB-28KB or 100KB and represented by this metric. S3 Glacier (GlacierStorage) : S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and low-cost storage class for data archiving. You can reliably store any amount of data at costs that are competitive with or cheaper than on-premises solutions. To keep costs low yet suitable for varying needs, S3 Glacier provides three retrieval options that range from a few minutes to hours. S3 Glacier Overhead (GlacierObjectOverhead) : For each object that is stored in S3 Glacier, 40 KB of chargeable overhead is added for metadata S3 Glacier Object Overhead (GlacierObjectOverhead) : Amazon S3 Glacier also requires an additional 32KB of data per object for S3 Glacier\u2019s index and metadata. S3 Glacier Deep Archive (DeepArchiveStorage) : S3 Glacier Deep Archive is Amazon S3\u2019s lowest-cost storage class and supports long-term retention and digital preservation for data that may be accessed once or twice in a year. It is designed for customers \u2014 particularly those in highly-regulated industries, such as the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Public Sectors \u2014 that retain data sets for 7-10 years or longer to meet regulatory compliance requirements. S3 Glacier Deep Archive can also be used for backup and disaster recovery use cases, and is a cost-effective and easy-to-manage alternative to magnetic tape systems, whether they are on-premises libraries or off-premises services. Deep Archive Object Overhead (DeepArchiveObjectOverhead) : For each object that is stored in S3 Glacier, 40 KB of chargeable overhead is added for metadata. Deep Archive S3 Object Overhead (DeepArchiveS3ObjectOverhead) : Amazon S3 Deep Archive also requires an additional 32KB of data per object for S3 Deep Archive index and metadata. Deep Archive Staging Storage (DeepArchiveStagingStorage) : Staging storage is where the parts of Multipart Upload are staged until the CompleteMultipart request is issued. The parts are staged in S3 standard, and storage is charged at the S3 Standard price. S3 Reduced Redundancy Storage : Reduced Redundancy Storage is an Amazon S3 storage option that enables customers to store noncritical, reproducible data at lower levels of redundancy than Amazon S3\u2019s standard storage. It provides a highly available solution for distributing or sharing content that is durably stored elsewhere, or for storing thumbnails, transcoded media, or other processed data that can be easily reproduced. The Reduced Redundancy option stores objects on multiple devices across multiple facilities, providing 400 times the durability of a typical disk drive, but does not replicate objects as many times as standard Amazon S3 storage. S3 Bucket Request Metrics S3 does not have ingress, egress or request metrics turned on by default, leaving many users unsure of what their costs will be until they receive their Monthly AWS Bill . That being said, it's relatively easy to enable these metrics. Below is an example of how to enable these metrics for a S3 Bucket via the AWS CLI.
